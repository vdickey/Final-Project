# Final-Project
Welcome to my final project! In this project, I am analyzing the differences in particle size means in 4 different sample sites where sand was collected around different areas of the same beach:
1. Log
2. Hay
3. Native Plant (denoted as NP)
4. Dune
The Dune sample is the control sample, the other 3 samples represent different types of restoration methods on the dunes.

A reference guide to indicate which samples belong to each site can be found in reference.txt in the data folder
Photos (.jpg) of each sample site can be found in the photos folder

Particle size data (.xls) and their overlays (.pdf) can be found in the data file

For the analysis, the mean data can be found in the analysis folder in mean_data (.xls and .csv)
To conduct a One-Way ANOVA, use the ANOVA_function.py file in the analysis folder
To conduct a power analysis, use the Power_analysis.py file in the analysis folder

You can find a Jupyter notebook that has tested the functions with the mean_data.csv is in the main project folder "test.ipynb"

You will need Spyder and Jupyter Notebook installed as packages for this Final Project.
